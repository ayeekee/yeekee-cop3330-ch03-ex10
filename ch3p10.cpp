/*
    Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result.
    Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants,
    for example, if (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables of type double. Implement this for operations
    called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.
